# Contributing

All contributions are welcome to this project!

The general process for contributing code is as follows:

1. Open an issue describing the desired feature, bug fix, or improvement you'd like to see before making any changes.
2. Assign the ticket to yourself, and/or leave a comment on the issue that you would like to work on it.
3. Fork the repository and make the necessary changes on a branch identified by the issue (e.g. `gh-##`). This ensures the branch is linked to the corresponding issue.
4. Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) for the maintainers of the repository to review.
5. Be sure to add the maintainers to the pull request as reviewers to ensure a speedy review.
6. Upon reviewing the changes, your change may be:
    * merged, requiring no further changes on your part.
    * annotated with a set of changes that must be made before the change will be merged.

## Unit Tests

All changes submitted must include updated unit tests (excluding documentation and configuration changes).
In order for your change to be accepted, the [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/indeedeng/cluster-preset) pipeline must complete successfully.

## Code of Conduct

ClusterPreset is governed by the [Contributor Covenant v1.4.1](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
